## What was that?
It was May 3rd, 2022 when I started working at Contentfly as a software engineer. I accepted the offer 'cause it's a fully remote company with a cool tech stack and a great product to work on - it was a good challenge.
<br>
<br>
One of the many perks that the company gives us is to have team retreats somewhere - now it was Panama time.
I got there May 30th until Jun 3rd, it was amazing, they booked us on a all inclusive resort where we could go to pools, have free drinks whatever we want and also some work sessions where we could interact and meet our co-workers better - in person.

Having contact with people all over the world is amazing. You can explore other cultures and have fun!
