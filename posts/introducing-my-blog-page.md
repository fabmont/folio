## Hello, world!
Well... it's a tradition for us developers to always run a `Hello World` command when learning a language/technology for the first time.
<br>
<br>
With this post won't be different.
The purpose of this post is to give you a hello and to tell you that this will be my space to talk about stuff I care/like the most (eg: frontend, programming, javascript, career, a situation that might happened to me and so on).
<br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy with this because I've been thinking about finishing this part of my web page for a while and now I finally could finish it, setting up everything etc.
<br>
~~Thanks COVID to give me time during quarantine to make me finish this üôÉ~~
<br>
<br>
Talking about tech, I built this whole web page with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as a component library & design system library.
<br>
<br>
Stay tunned and enjoy this space that I created with care and passion ‚ù§Ô∏è.
<br>
<br>
PS: I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjeefD8sac) as a guide when I was setting up the whole blog system with NextJS.
