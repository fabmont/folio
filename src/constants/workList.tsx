          This was a project I had the pleasure to be part of during my
          graduation in Software Engineering. With this project I had my first
          contact with React Native (and after React.js).

          &quot;Onde Joga?&quot; or <i>&quot;Where I throw away?&quot;</i> was
          an app that allowed users to report trash on streets. With that the
          government authorities could see where they needed to put efforts to
          clean up the street trash.

        <Paragraph>
          With this project I could study technologies such as React, React
          Native, JavaScript, Firebase, CSS and Redux.

          Coopersystem was the place were I definitely started my career as a
          software engineer. I had the pleasure to work with talented people who
          taught me a lot of things both technical and soft skills.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I could work on more than 5 projects using React / React Native for a
          bunch of Coopersystem&apos;s clients. So all these experiences helped
          me improving my knowledge with the JS/React stack.

          Also, I could test, implement and purpose new architectures on top of
          React to apply on several projects. Tutoring junior developers of my
          squads was also a role I had.
