          Coopersystem was the place were I definitely started my career as a
          software engineer. I had the pleasure to work with talented people who
          taught me a lot of things both technical and soft skills.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I could work on more than 5 projects using React / React Native for a
          bunch of Coopersystem&apos;s clients. So all these experiences helped
          me improving my knowledge with the JS/React stack.

        <Paragraph>
          Also, I could test, implement and purpose new architectures on top of
          React to apply on several projects. Tutoring junior developers of my
          squads was also a role I had.

          system, and a React component library that applied the Appen&apos;s
          design system that helped the engineers write less code having
          reusable components.
